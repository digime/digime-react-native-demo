# digi.me React-Native Demo
This is a **proof of concept demonstrator** to show React-Native being used to create native apps using the native [Android][sdk-android]  and [iOS][sdk-ios] digi.me SDKs to make content and data requests. For more details on the digi.me API and the Consent Access architecture please visit the [developer support docs][ca-flow].

## Preamble
The React-Native demo depends on the [digi.me app][download] installed on the target platform to enable user authentication of Consent Access requests.

## Prerequisites
- [Yarn][download-yarn] - Package and dependency manager for node
- [ImageMagick][download-image-magick] - used to resize image assets for native images

### For iOS development ###
- [CocoaPods][download-cocoapods] - Package management for iOS development. Used to get the iOS digi.me SDK

### For Android development ###
- [Java Development Kit (Java SE Development Kit JDK)][download-jdk]
- [Android Studio][download-android-studio]. Please ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set.

## Installation and First Run
Install the dependencies used for the project
```
yarn install
```

Compile Typescript to JavaScript and copy assets to the ./dist/ folder
```
yarn compile
```

Generate native images, copy assets to native projects, and update native code
```
yarn configure-native
```

Start Android
Ensure that an Android device is connected or an Android virtual device is running
```
yarn run-android
```

Start iOS
```
yarn run-ios
```

## Configuring SDKs
### The Contract ID and App ID
Before accessing the public APIs, a valid _Contract ID_ and _App ID_ are required. The Contract ID uniquely identifies a contract with the user that defines what type of data you want, how much you will get (from a defined time range), what you will and won't do with it, how long you will retain it for and if you will implement the right to be forgotten. It also specifies how the data is encrypted in transit.

### The .p12 File
All content retrieved by the SDK is encrypted in transit using the public key bound to the certificate that was created when the Consent Access contract was created. For the SDK to be able to decrypt content transparently a matching private key must be provided (ie. from the keypair created for contract). The .p12 file is an archive format that's used to bundle the private key with its certificate. Digi.me SDK accepts PKCS #12 encoded files as the default key storage format.

To register a Consent Access contract check out [digi.me developer support][support]. There you can request a Contract ID and App ID to which it is bound.

### Configuring React-Native
Upon obtaining the Contract ID, App ID, .p12 file (and its passphrase).
1. Add the .p12 file to the top level [./assets/keys][dir-keys] sub directory.
2. Update the references used in the [./src/constants/Constants.ts][file-constants] file;

```
    public static readonly APPLICATION_NAME: string = "[YOUR APPLICATION_NAME]";
    public static readonly APPLICATION_ID: string = "[YOUR APPLICATION_ID]";
    public static readonly CONTRACT_ID: string = "[YOUR CONTRACT_ID]";
    public static readonly P12_PASSPHRASE: string = "[YOUR P12_PASSWORD]";
    public static readonly P12_FILENAME: string = "[YOUR P12_FILENAME]";
    ...
```

3. Run `yarn compile`
4. Run `yarn configure-native`
5. For iOS development, please also import the p12 file into the xcode project.

This script copies the p12 assets from the [keys directory][dir-keys] to their native Android and iOS directories, it also updates the native code to add the application and contract references (e.g, updates the [Android strings.xml](file-android-strings) using the [Android SDK][sdk-android] expected string name and provided values).

## Typescript and SDK interaction
Both the native Android and iOS subprojects have been configured to use their respective SDKs. In this PoC, both native projects contain a class `NativeBridge` [(Android) NativeBridge.java][file-android-nativebridge] [(iOS) NativeBridge.m][file-ios-nativebridge]. The NativeBridge currently exposes only one function, `initSDK()` which is called from the JavaScript code to start the native authorisation process.

The native code dispatches [events][file-events] to communicate data back to the JavaScript code. Currently events are dispatched on receiving file data via CA, and accept or rejection of the Consent Access contract from the digi.me app.

### Compiling and running
If changes have been made to the typescript, then both the JavaScript and the React-Native platform specific bundles must be created
Run `yarn compile-run-android` or `yarn compile-run-ios` to compile JavaScript and run the app on Android or iOS.

If (only) changes to the native Android or iOS code have been made, then the JavaScript and native bundles don't need to be recompiled or created.
Run `yarn run-android` or `yarn run-ios` to run the app. Alternatively, open the and run the native code in [(Android) Android Studio][download-android-studio] or [(iOS) XCode][download-xcode].
